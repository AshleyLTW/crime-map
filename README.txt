Tested modules: 

Textract
PyPDF2
Tabula (works well enough, will take some RegEx finangling, but is usable)
Camelot (works very nicely, but completely omits time and address line other than first line) <- take that back. I think it works perfectly
- Unfortuantely, exporting all at once doesn't seem to be working
